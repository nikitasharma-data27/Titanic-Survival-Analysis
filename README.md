## Data
Source: Kaggle â€” Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.

## EDA Highlights
- Women and children had much higher survival rates.
- 1st-class passengers survived more often than 3rd-class.
- Key correlated features: **Sex**, **Pclass**, **Fare**.

## Modeling
- Model: Logistic Regression
- Validation accuracy: **~81%**
- Key metrics: see notebook (classification report + confusion matrix).
